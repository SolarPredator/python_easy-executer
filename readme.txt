Easy execute is a Python program based around the CLI to create a bat file for any .py file

to use it, activiate the batch file or(if no batch file) .py and follow the instructions 

WARNING: The program assumes that there's a batch file in place when using the function "execute batch file"
         If the user makes no batch file, use "create batch file" to create a batch file

The only currently working method is creating a subfolder inside the FILES folder, created when first starting the program
Then, create a subfolder in FILES to put the .py file in. See example below:
FILE
  > program(subfolder)
     > program.py
