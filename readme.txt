Easy execute is a python program based around the CLI to create a bat file for any .py file

to use it, activiate the batch file or(if no batch file) .py and follow the instructions 

WARNING: The program asumes that theres a batch file in place when using the function "execute batch file"
         if no batch file is made by the user, use "create batch file" to create a batch file

The only currently working method of working is creating a subfolder inside the FILES folder, created when first starting the program
Then when created a sub folder in FILES, put in there, the .py file
